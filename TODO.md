- Call arguments in function body
- First class functions that have a variable with a name coinciding with the function beign called triggers and error, as there are qoute on qoute duplicate names, this should throw an error if the first class function is not a function macro. If it is a macro, rename the variables to non occuring variables. This could be done by a pair that holds its original value as well as it's alias.
